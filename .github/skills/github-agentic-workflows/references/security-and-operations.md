# Security And Operations

Use this reference when a workflow needs security review, authentication design, or day-two operations.

## Security Model Summary

GitHub Agentic Workflows uses layered controls:

1. Substrate trust: GitHub Actions runners, container isolation, AWF, API proxy, and MCP gateway isolation.
2. Configuration trust: validated frontmatter, permissions, tool wiring, network rules, and token placement.
3. Plan trust: staged execution and safe outputs so the agent does not write directly to repository state.

Professional use starts by assuming prompts, tools, and repository content can be adversarial or misleading.

## Least-Privilege Defaults

Prefer these defaults unless the workflow has a concrete reason to differ:

1. `permissions: read-all` or explicit read permissions.
2. Safe outputs for issues, comments, labels, pull requests, reviews, dispatch, and agent assignment.
3. Minimal `toolsets:` rather than broad GitHub or shell access.
4. `strict: true`.
5. `network.allowed` with `defaults` plus the smallest extra ecosystem or custom domains set.

Avoid direct `contents: write`, `issues: write`, or `pull-requests: write` on the agentic execution path when a safe output can model the same outcome.

## Safe Outputs

Safe outputs are the core professional pattern for repository writes.

Key points:

1. The agent runs read-only and emits structured actions.
2. Separate permission-controlled jobs apply those actions after validation.
3. Common outputs include `create-issue`, `add-comment`, `add-labels`, `create-pull-request`, `dispatch-workflow`, `call-workflow`, `assign-to-agent`, and `create-agent-session`.
4. `noop`, `missing-tool`, and `missing-data` are critical truthfulness and reliability tools.
5. `staged: true` is the safest rollout mode for new write-heavy workflows.

Professional prompt rule:

```text
If no action is needed, the agent MUST call noop with a concise explanation.
```

Without an emitted safe output, a safe-output workflow can fail at runtime even when analysis was correct.

## Network Policy

Use `network:` as both an egress control and a content-sanitization allowlist.

Recommended pattern:

```yaml
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - node
    - "api.example.com"
```

Guidance:

1. Prefer ecosystem identifiers such as `node`, `python`, `containers`, or `github`.
2. Add custom domains explicitly.
3. Use blocked domains when privacy or compliance requires it.
4. Treat `(redacted)` URLs as a signal that the allowlist is incomplete.
5. Keep the firewall enabled in production.
6. If the installed compiler rejects custom domains in strict mode, keep the firewall narrow and fetch the needed sources in deterministic setup steps so the agent reads local files instead of making ad hoc outbound requests.

## Authentication

Engine authentication:

1. Copilot: `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
2. Claude: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
3. Codex: `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
4. Gemini: `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

Additional authentication is usually required for:

1. Cross-repository reads or writes.
2. GitHub Projects operations.
3. Remote GitHub tool mode.
4. Assigning Copilot or creating advanced safe outputs.

Use a GitHub App when possible for short-lived, scoped tokens. Copilot engine authentication itself still requires a PAT.

## Public Repository Safety

Public repositories need extra care.

1. Keep GitHub lockdown mode enabled for workflows that inspect user-generated content unless the workflow is explicitly low-risk.
2. Use restrictive safe outputs and approval controls for anything that can modify repository state.
3. Keep network policy narrow.
4. Review threat-detection prompts or steps for code-changing workflows.

If lockdown is blocking legitimate external contributor scenarios, change the workflow design before disabling protection.

## Observability And Operations

Use the CLI to manage production quality:

```bash
gh aw status
gh aw logs <workflow>
gh aw audit <run-id>
gh aw health
```

Use these signals:

1. Success rate and trend.
2. Token usage and cost.
3. Firewall denials and blocked domains.
4. Tool usage and missing-tool events.
5. Threat-detection outcomes.
6. Safe-output previews versus actual writes.

## Operational Hygiene

1. Keep workflows small and single-purpose.
2. Use shared imports only when reuse is real and maintained.
3. Pin or review CLI versions deliberately in controlled environments.
4. Use `gh aw update` for sourced workflows and `gh aw upgrade` for repository-wide modernization.
5. Treat `.lock.yml` files as build artifacts that must stay in sync with compile-time changes.
6. Re-run validation and verbose compile output after a CLI upgrade before concluding that a workflow shape is still valid.
