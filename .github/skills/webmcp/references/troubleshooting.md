# WebMCP Troubleshooting

## `navigator.modelContext` is undefined

1. Confirm the code runs in a browser window context, not on the server.
2. Confirm the page is in a secure context.
3. Confirm the target Chrome build meets the preview version requirement.
4. Confirm `chrome://flags/#enable-webmcp-testing` is enabled when using the preview.
5. If the feature must run in a worker or headlessly, stop and redirect the design because WebMCP does not support that mode.

## `registerTool()` throws `InvalidStateError`

1. Check whether the tool name is already registered.
2. Check whether `name` is an empty string.
3. Check whether `description` is an empty string.
4. If the route or page state changes, unregister stale tools before registering replacements.

## `registerTool()` throws `TypeError` or serialization errors

1. Check that `inputSchema` is plain JSON-compatible data.
2. Remove circular references from `inputSchema`.
3. Remove custom serialization logic that returns `undefined` or non-JSON values.
4. Reduce the schema to a minimal plain object, then add properties back incrementally.

## Imperative tool runs but the page stays stale

1. Update the UI and application state before resolving the tool result.
2. Confirm that async state updates complete before the tool returns.
3. Keep the human path and agent path on the same state transition logic rather than duplicating side effects.

## Declarative form is not behaving as a tool

1. Check that the `<form>` has both `toolname` and `tooldescription`.
2. Check that the form controls have stable `name` attributes.
3. Check that labels or `toolparamdescription` exist for fields that need clear parameter descriptions.
4. If using custom submit handling, call `preventDefault()` before `respondWith()`.
5. Return explicit validation errors for agent-invoked submits instead of relying only on HTML validation UI.

## Agent-invoked submit does not return useful output

1. Confirm the code only calls `respondWith()` for the agent-driven path.
2. Return descriptive, structured results or corrective errors rather than empty values.
3. If the page redirects after submit, verify that the resulting document still reflects the completed action.

## Preview-only events or styles are missing

1. Check whether the implementation actually targets the current Chrome preview.
2. Treat `toolactivated`, `toolcancel`, `agentInvoked`, `:tool-form-active`, and `:tool-submit-active` as preview-only behavior.
3. Do not make core application logic depend exclusively on those preview signals.

## Old examples mention removed APIs

1. Remove any use of `provideContext` or `clearContext`.
2. Remove any use of `toolparamtitle`.
3. Align the integration with the current WebMCP surface instead of reviving removed names.

## Deterministic validation is hard

1. Use the Model Context Tool Inspector to inspect the registered tool set and invoke tools manually.
2. Test imperative and declarative flows without an LLM before optimizing descriptions for natural-language routing.
3. After manual validation passes, test with an agent to refine descriptions and parameter design.
